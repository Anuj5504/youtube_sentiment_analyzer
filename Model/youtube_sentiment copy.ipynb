The very people — the Jewish leaders — who conspired and were involved in the attempted killing of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), are now being supported and embraced by many Christian nations. But think for a moment — if Christians truly follow the teachings of Jesus, if they truly love him as their Prophet and Savior, how can they stand in support of those who rejected him, mocked him, and plotted to kill him?\\n\\n📖 Bible (New Testament) proves this clearly:\\n\\n> “Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans to have Jesus executed. So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.”\\n— Matthew 27:1–2\\n\\n\\n\\n> “As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, ‘Crucify! Crucify!’”\\n— John 19:6\\n\\n\\n\\n🕊️ These verses show that it was the religious leaders of the Jews who demanded the crucifixion of Jesus. The Roman Empire (Pilate) only carried out the sentence.\\n\\nIn contrast, Muslims have never harmed Jesus. In fact, Muslims love and honor him deeply. We believe in his miraculous birth, his prophethood, his message, and that he was one of the mightiest messengers of God. In Islam, he is called Isa ibn Maryam (عليه السلام).\\n\\n📖 Qur’an confirms this with clarity:\\n\\n> “…they said, ‘We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah’ — but they neither killed him nor crucified him. It was only made to appear so to them...”\\n— Surah An-Nisa (4:157)\\n\\n\\n\\n➡️ The Qur’an teaches that Jesus was not killed but was raised up by Allah. He will return before the Day of Judgment.\\n\\nToday, ironically, the Jews not only rejected Jesus — they still deny him. So why are Christians standing with those who continue to reject and dishonor their beloved Prophet?\\n\\nIt's time for sincere Christians to reflect on this truth. If you truly walk in the footsteps of Jesus, you should stand for the truth — not with those who once plotted against him.\\n\\nThe only community that has always honored Jesus (peace be upon him) — without distortion, without denial — is the Muslim Ummah.\\n\\nLet us come together on what unites us: belief in One God, and respect for His chosen Prophets.\", 'Israel is world devil country', 'This is going straight into my favorites playlist', 'Algorithm finally did something right', 'The editing is top-tier.

You can request to check specially for certain ones ie  cat, dog, dust, grass pollen etc or get an extended panel, & work from there. \\nSome people notice they suffer at particular times of yr, ie summer with high pollen count  and therefore need to take an antihistamine  beforehand and during that timeframe to prevent allergies. Popping one when you've symptoms doesnt prevent just lessings the symptoms.\\nMatt would be a great pet owner however hes right he has to consider  not just his allergies but his siblings. Also has to consider  the work and commitment that goes into being a responsible pet owner. They travel quite a bit so would need pet sitter which is completely manageable. I agree with him a cat would suit better than a dog, as cats can be left alone during the day a bit longer when their out, than dogs. Cats also dont have to but can be walked lol.\\nIn relation  to what everyones talking about stalking, unfortunately its part & parcel of their job being in the public eye. Im sure their in this game long enough to be aware of it & how to deal with it. What everyone needs to remember is to be respectful,  & mindful that they share enough of their lives online, & deserve rightfully so some privacy  in relation to protecting their addresses, their family, friends & relationships. I believe you cannot share everything in your life  online, for your own peace, sanity & enjoyment you need to keep some things private for your own  self!\\nAnd finally to Nick  & all those who celebrate it, happy pride month to you all!\", '“I just want to go to the doctor and bend over…”.  😂😂😂😂😂😂', 'Go call kalogera sisters and meet them in a vid', 'dont sheet ur bed.', 'Title says part 2.

She said this resolution is very important because it can remind and inform the public that such cruel persecution and inhumane things are happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her speech, Ms. Tang, a local Falun Gong practitioner representative, thanked the city councilors for their support of human rights and religious freedom. Ms. Tang said that this action is particularly meaningful as the holiday approaches, because the American people freely celebrate their traditional religious festivals, but Falun Gong practitioners in China face imprisonment, torture and death because of their beliefs. She added that this courageous resolution will bring blessings to the residents of Manassas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalun Gong practitioner Wang Chunyan, who has personally experienced the persecution in China’s labor camps, and who worked with the city to pass the resolution, said that in China, the CCP’s persecution confuses people’s perception. She told of her personal experience to the American people in order to let them know that there is still such an evil regime in the world that harms people. Ms. Wang said that righteous people should work together to oppose and stop this persecution, so that mankind can return to normality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the Virginia House of Delegates and 25 counties have passed similar resolutions in the past two years, and the Governor of Virginia and five cities in the state have issued proclamations or resolutions to support Falun Gong.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResolution from the City of Manassas \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Resolution from the City Of Manassas states, “To raise awareness among Manassas residents and the medical community of the risks of traveling to China for organ transplants in light of recent reports of state-sponsored organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. \\r\\n\\r\\n“in June 2016, the United States House of Representatives unanimously passed House Resolution 343, condemning the systemic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from practitioners of Falun Gong and other prisoners of conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Manassas residents should be fully informed of the organ source in China before they make the decision to engage in organ transplant tourism in China, and the Manassas City Council should assist in raising awareness in this regard. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, therefore, Be it resolved that the City Council of the City of Manassas hereby condemns the Chinese Communist regime’s persecution of Falun Gong, harvesting of organs from prisoners of conscience in China, and use of prisoners of conscience for slave labor in China.”\", 'Queensland pawafull', 'The pivots need to know the capability of the players around them to be able to create try scoring opportunities for them.

Then followed the events of fnaf 1, 2, and 3.

It's so well done, so representative. Clancy seems to be cracking up, he doesn't even know why he's fighting anymore, and one of the things that's going on is that he thinks the Torchbearer isn't real, that he's been deceiving him all along because he's just a “hallucination”, using his power of projection to be at Clancy's side. And remember the Torchbearer's letter marked “dear clancy”, the letter in which he explained everything to her precisely so that he wouldn't feel betrayed, and in which he explained his power. It had traces of black paint on it, which means it was intercepted and Clancy didn't read it, so he doesn't know Josh was there.\\n\\nAnd he himself, in his struggle, can't take it anymore, all those red eyes could represent all the versions of him that have failed, all the mistakes he's made and the things he doesn't want to do again. The contract represents the union between him and the Torchbearer, a contract he's going to break in a desperate last-ditch attempt to take control by rallying with the Bishops.\\n\\n\\nThe clip clearly takes place in his head, showing very well what's going on there and what a mess it is. “I check, the doors, the windows, the blinds...” This shows very well the anxiety over the idea of Blurry's return, the “necromancer” being Nico. And it also shows that he seems to be closing in on himself completely, and is doing so to try and regain control alone and break everything up, as well as his union with the Banditos to take things back into his own hands and not be the failed attempts of the past that he clearly can't stand anymore. “And I'm just trying to stay quiet”. By possibly becoming a Bishop, he thinks he can take absolute control because he can't stand the endless struggle.\\n\\nThe music and video are fast-paced, effects-packed and monstrously effervescent, illustrating the chaos in Clancy's head. \\r\\nAnd the lyrics “I want to get out of there but I don't try” are also truly magnificent. To put it plainly, he withdraws, breaks down and shatters everything he's built up to now in order to take control. And this music and video clip show very well the situation and state of mind he's in when he makes this choice.

The band was formed in 2009 and currently consists of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun.[1] After two self-released albums, Twenty One Pilots in 2009 and Regional at Best in 2011, they were signed by Fueled by Ramen in 2012,[2] which released their following studio albums,[3][4] as well as Blurryface Live, a three-LP, tri-gatefold picture disc vinyl,[5] Scaled and Icy (Livestream Version) and MTV Unplugged.\\n\\nThe duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album Blurryface in 2015, which produced the successful singles \"Stressed Out\" and \"Ride\". In addition, the single \"Heathens\", recorded for the soundtrack of the film Suicide Squad, made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States.\\n\\nThe duo\\'s fifth studio album, Trench, was released on October 5, 2018,[4] followed by their sixth, Scaled and Icy, on May 21, 2021,[6] and their seventh, Clancy, released on May 24, 2024. They are the first and currently only artist in history to have each song from two separate studio albums (Vessel and Blurryface) certified at least gold by the RIAA. They have won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance,[7] and Joseph has been nominated for six Grammy Awards in total.[8] The band\\'s eighth studio album, Breach, is set to be released in September 2025.', 'Great job, this video was very useful!', '21,252 comments. \\nlove this\\nso much', 'Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!', 'This was super helpful, thanks!', 'This was very informative, appreciate it.', 'Great job, this video was very useful!', 'Really appreciate the insights in this video.', 'Bendito sea el sordo 🗣️🔥', 'This is giving Black Ops Zombies vibes 😭', 'I just want to see an editing breakdown of this', \"I sense the employment of AI in creating this specific song, but i don't mind.

You have to remember \"There\\'s faith and there\\'s sleep, we need to pick one please. Because faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think and for us to think is to be alive.\"\\n\\nSo sleep is imagery for the opposite of faith. In \"The Contract,\" Clancy is keeping himself awake to force himself to stay true to his \"promises and contracts I used to keep\" with God, but it\\'s not a healthy awake. He\\'s questioning the confidence he used to have that God/Torchbearer is real, wondering if those past certainties in God\\'s existence were just \"my hallucinations I used to see.\"\\n\\nThis song also connects with Ode to Sleep, where he says \"I won\\'t tell you who I\\'m singing towards, metaphorically I\\'m a whore and that\\'s denial number four.\" \\nIn The Contract, even though he\\'s barely still keeping his faith \"awake,\" he\\'s \"just tryna stay quiet\" about it. Sometimes he does fall asleep [lose faith], and then he wakes up (regaining faith barely) but wondering \"is it light out yet?\" Is his faith even justified by God\\'s presence? Or is everything just darkness regardless of whether he holds onto faith or not? He doesn\\'t have enough confidence to share his faith, so \"walk[s] around the edge of the room and bed\" and hides his face and paces around.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t want to be a coward about sharing his faith. \"I wanna get out there but I don\\'t try.\"\\n\\nClancy reflects on his past certainty in faith, saying \"I used to see, it felt so real, but now I plead just take the deal. I promised you a contract.\" To me this sounds like asking the Torchbearer (God) to honor his end of the contract. Sounds like Clancy promised allegiance and faith but in return wanted God to show himself. This is very similar to songs like Trees and Implicit Demand for Proof.\\n\\nTo me, this is the most internally consistent explanation for The Contract lyrics.

I myself would never do that to my boyfriend also I hate to say it it’s not a good look for anyone to be asking their partner when are they getting married.

About 30 minutes into the drive I put on one of your videos and we binged your videos for the next 11 hours straight to Lake Charles Louisiana. We got up the next morning and enjoyed listening to your videos so much, that we took turns driving on the way back for 23 hour and 41 minutes without stopping to a bit north of San Diego California without stopping to rest. After I got home we immediately went to watch the IMSA race at Laguna Seca and listened to your videos all the way up there and back. The submarine stories are always of particular interest because of the fact that my grandfather is a retired Master Chief that served on submarines for 22 years and it has been of great interest to me ever since. Thank you for everything that you do as I promote your videos as much as I can as a former Commanding Officer of my NJROTC unit in high school to the younger generation so they can be better educated. It has also become a thing that we do as a family watching your new videos and we all appreciate your work. Another brief side note if you want to go down a very interesting rabbit hole about the way a US Sub got 13 Presidential Unit Citations during the Cold War, look up Operation Ivy Bells or read “Blind Man’s Bluff”. I promise it is worth your time and interest. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a fantastic day.', \"Thank you for doing this story on an AlvinYork, i'm a tennesseen.
